print ("""During this 40days of programming, I look forward to learning python as a programming language. Coding is one of the necessary skills in this new age which in my case will be handy for ease in scientific analysis. Though I am also busy with my Masters thesis this time as well, I am really excited and enthusiatic about learning programming despite my tight schedule because I believe it is a rare privilege. I have decided to sacrifice my time and energy so as to learn as much as possible during the weeks and I am also determined to put my best into it. Since I am a novice in coding and programming, I want to utilize this opportunity to know more about it and if possible, be able to share this knowledge with others as well. I want to be able to build computer programmes that will impact the agricultural sector because that is my field. I look forward to learning and understanding terms used in programming. I am fully convinced that I will learn a great deal within this 40 days. Big thanks to the organizers""")
